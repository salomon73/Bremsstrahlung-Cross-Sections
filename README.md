# Screened Thin-Target Bremsstrahlung

Computation and analysis tools for **screened thin-target bremsstrahlung** emission with **partially ionized high-Z species**.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the scripts and data accompanying the submitted paper:

> **S. Guinchard, Y. Savoye-Peysson, J. Decker**  
> *Screened Thin-Target Bremsstrahlung with Partially Ionized High-Z Species.*
> *arXiV* to be added here

It provides numerical **MATLAB** implementations for evaluating and plotting bremsstrahlung cross sections, including **screening corrections** based on a multi-Yukawa potential model.  
All figures from the publication can be reproduced from the scripts provided.
